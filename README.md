# ðŸ§  Write Your Own OS â€“ From Scratch (Inspired by Nanobyte YouTube Series)

This project is a learning-oriented, step-by-step implementation of a basic Operating System from scratch using x86 assembly and low-level system programming. It closely follows the excellent Nanobyte OS Development Playlist(https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFjM7v6KGMpiH2G-kT781ByCNC_0pKpPN&si=pZiOinQBH7FG0LSc) on YouTube.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a bootable 16-bit Operating System using NASM assembly language, and understand:

* How bootloaders work
* How BIOS interacts with code
* How to print to the screen
* Memory layout
* OS fundamentals from a very low level

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Install these tools:

* [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) â€“ Netwide Assembler
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) â€“ For running the OS (or VirtualBox)
* [WSL / Linux / Mac / Windows (with terminal access)]
* A code editor (`micro`, `vim`, `VSCode`, etc.)
